## This folder contains codes for generating the relationship between vegetation index (VI) and urbanization intensity (![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\beta)), and calculating the indirect impact ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\omega_i).

- [**1_data_preprocess.ipynb**](https://github.com/zlxy9892/Global_Urbanization_Impacts_on_Vegetation/blob/main/generate_vi_ui_relationship/1_data_preprocess.ipynb): The python code for cleaning the raw data.
- [**2_calculate_VI_vs_UI_in_each_city.ipynb**](https://github.com/zlxy9892/Global_Urbanization_Impacts_on_Vegetation/blob/main/generate_vi_ui_relationship/2_calculate_VI_vs_UI_in_each_city.ipynb): The python code for generating the relationship between VI and UI (including the zero-impact line which only consider the direct impact, and fitted observed VI~UI curve). The indirect impact (Wi) can be calculated by the difference between fitted VI values and VI on the zero-impact line.
- [**3_calculate_VI_vs_UI_in_climate_zones.ipynb**](https://github.com/zlxy9892/Global_Urbanization_Impacts_on_Vegetation/blob/main/generate_vi_ui_relationship/3_calculate_VI_vs_UI_in_climate_zones.ipynb): The python code for generating the relationship between VI and UI by aggregating data of cities across globe and different climate zones.
